# Folder Organizer

Sorts all files in a selected folder into categorized subfolders based on file type. Useful for cleaning up cluttered directories like Downloads or project folders.

## What It Does

- Automatically creates folders by file type (Documents, Images, Code Files, etc.)
- Moves files into the appropriate category
- Uses a simple GUI (via `easygui`) for folder selection and confirmation
- Prints all moved files to the terminal

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `easygui` module  
  Install with:  
  ```bash
  pip install easygui
  ```

## Usage

Just run the script:

```bash
python3 folder-organizer.py
```

1. A GUI will prompt you to select the folder to organize.
2. Youâ€™ll be asked to confirm before anything is moved.
3. Files are then sorted by type and placed into subfolders.

## File Categories (Examples)

- Documents: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.xls`
- Images: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`
- Videos: `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`
- Audio: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`
- Code Files: `.py`, `.js`, `.cpp`, `.html`, `.ahk`
- Archives: `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`
- Miscellaneous: everything else
